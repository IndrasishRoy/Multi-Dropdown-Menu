# Multi-Dropdown-Menu
Welcome to the Readme of Multi-Dropdown Menu.

Details: I created a Multi-Dropdown Menu by using HTML and CSS only. The transitions are very smooth and the color combination is really soothing. It is easy for those(beginners) who are having problem while creating a Dropdown Menu using JavaScript and want to use CSS for now.
*P.S. Only for the practice of beginners, who are having problem while creating a Dropdown Menu using JavaScript.

Type:
• Dropdown Menu

Languages Used:
• HTML(39.9%)
• CSS(55.6%)

I hope you'll have a good experience after using this Dropdown Menu and will like my work.

Thank You!
