# Multi-Dropdown-Menu
Welcome to the Readme of Multi-Dropdown Menu.

## Details:
I created a Multi-Dropdown Menu by using HTML and CSS only. The transitions are very smooth and the color combination is really soothing. It is easy for those(beginners) who are having problem while creating a Dropdown Menu using JavaScript and want to use CSS for now.
*P.S. Only for the practice of beginners, who are having problem while creating a Dropdown Menu using JavaScript.

I hope this Dropdown Menu will be helpful for many beginners in Front-End Development and will like my work.

Thank You!
